# parking-spot-detection-cv-machine-learning

Computer vision is fun! 

In this project I tried to predict available parking spots using machine learning. For this, I used data provided by computervisioneng that contained videos and masks that made the project easier. Once the model was ready to use, I exported it with pickle to a computer vision script that captured all the available parking spots. 

This is a good project to practice both machine learning and computer vision. 

I used data provided by computervisioneng in this repo: https://github.com/computervisioneng/parking-space-counter/tree/master

Hope you find it interesting!
